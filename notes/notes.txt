compulsive impatience, aoe debuff - when player takes action with unit that is not this unit while this unit is ready, this units suffers 1 pure damage, removed when this unit is activated.
soul tether - debuff two targets, keeps track of maximum seen distance between units, both suffer a pure damage for each distance max seen distance is extended.
corpse explosion - aoe - multiple corpses same square combined into single damage instance - corpses of dead units explode recursively
star shaped aoe
full invisibility - removed on attack until next action - removed when blocking opponent unit?
thoughts about "standard play"
    an army is build for a map pool (prob 5)
    a map is a procedure for generating a symmetrical set of hexes to play on
    map decides both the size/shape of the board (although generally this will prob be pretty standardized), the capture/deployment zones (prob also pretty standardized) and the terrain (should vary a lot)
    the map also defines the size of the deployment (how many points worth of units you get from your army). prob also a max amount of units?
    a game first involves one player being presented with a random subset of the pool (prob 4) and banning some about (prob 2). then the other player selects the map from the remaining ones (prob 2 remaining).
    then each player simultaneously decides their deployment and places it in their deployment zone, then plays the "actual" game.
    map is also responsible for defining point win threshold, and max number of rounds (normally this should be a standardized safety valve, but there is design space in "who can get more points in 3 rounds or whatever").
    this way you can easily have a "rotating" format, and different unit strengths can be more and less relevant. building an army for a map pool should be a cool balancing act.
unit price resources?
    units have a generic point value that describes how much they are worth, but maybe there should also be other resources, associated with specific mechanics/specializations/roles? this way maps get to fine tune how much "value" worth of flyers a player gets for example. this allows for more extreme map variety, where for example a map with a lot of obstacles doesn't just become all flyers.
    something like:
        - white (w) - mobility
        - blue (u) - flyer
        - red (r) - ranged
        - green (g) - high value units (if this can't be limited, then you might end up in a situation where the correct thing is to get very few units on a very small map, for very boring gameplay. alternatively a map can just ban units costing>n?)
        This prob makes sense as "pure fighting ability", i.e. "damage per turn" * "effective health", so small maps isn't just all the slowest units standing in a clump and hitting each other.
        - purple (p) - support/spells/high synergy
    maybe also a vision one?
stealth while not moving
map ideas:

    note about directions (P1, P2 are starting areas):

        N
    W P1 P2 E 
        S

    jungle brawl
        small map, dense forest / jungle terrain. maybe clearing in the center? low flyer resource.
    river
        map divided by (not unbroken river) W-E. medium terrain
    jotunheim
        bunch of ice, with a lava crag in the middle. close to lave water is ice instead etc.
    frosty peaks
        large maps with sporadic wood clusters and jagged mountain lines. mountains are snow in the center of the clusters
    trench war
        mostly flat with low vegetation. Two crack lines divide the map N-S.
    arid mesa
        large platou in the middle surrounded by mostly flat desert.
    oasis
        lake in the middle, surrounded desert/shrub/dunes. middle capture zone is a ring surrounding lake
    in medias res
        starting areas very close to each other. one time player specific point pickups behind opponent for each player
        hilly landscape, medium vegetation
    swamp mix-up
        medium-sized map with thick jungle/swamp, multiple small scattered deployment zones
    cauldron
        middle capture area surrounded by unpassable mountain ring, with a few gaps. medium elevation, sparse vegetation, except for the middle.

"bat" sight, can only see presence of unit, nothing else.
raise dead - corpse as generic skeleton - merge multiple corpses into more powerful creature?
energy overcharge
ambush trapdoor spider
storm summoner - AA
day/night cycle?
    night -1 sight (min 1)
    amount of rounds of day/night in a cycle, and where in the cycle the game starts can vary depending on map
weather (bloat, this time for real). but maybe these can just be like global statuses on certain maps?
    hot
        units ending turn with no unspent movement points suffer 1 damage
    cold
        units ending round with no adjacent allied units suffer 1 damage
    rain
        -1 sight (min 1)
    windy
        -1 movement air units
identities?
    could have resource bonuses, like:
        all units below n points -1 point cost
        all units above n points -2 points cost
        +n points/resource
        bonus for unit duplicates / uniques
        discount units costing certain resources
    opponents hero is visible while deploying
bog witch
force wall
    aoe ability
    aoe type line length 3 range 3
    cooldown 2 rounds
    each hex gets force blocked for 2 rounds
        unstackable, refreshable
        a unit moving into this hex loses all remaining movement points

this one's dumb, like the shrivel idea, though:
    depressor
    movement 3, health 5, sight 2, S
    entropic ray
        ranged attack
        2 damage, 2 range
        -1 movement
    shrivel
        aoe ability
        aoe type hex size 1 range 4
        -2 movement
        apply shriveled to all units in aoe until they skip
            stackable
            -1 max health

debuff - double damage taken
corpse explosion
effect removes stacks/duration of all debuffs
exhaustion - debuff stack n - when unit ends non skip action, takes n damage. when ends skip action, remove stack of exhaustion
