corpses, like homm, cool design space + confirmation things died in fow
transportation
	can contain n units
	contained units die with transport by default
	by default unit can walk into transport, ending turn
	by default, units can start their turn in transport. only legal action is move out.
resistance to (damage to). half damage rounded up after reductions
	blur - resistance to ranged
	hardened carapace - resistance to aoe
	ethereal - resistance to melee / ranged
greater resistance - round down instead
damage cap, like "the heart"
spider sense, like slark
complulsive impatience, aoe debuff - when player takes action with unit that is not this unit while this unit is ready, this units suffers 1 pure damage, removed when this unit is activated.
soul tether - debuff two targets, keeps track of maximum seen distance between units, both suffer a pure damage for each distance max seen distance is extended.

barbed wire - terrain status - space +1 movement into/from penalty - unit on space has special combineable action -2 movement to remove wire.
single tile smoke
double tile smoke
full invisibility - removed on attack until next action - removed when blocking opponent unit?
additional turns (within round only prob)
OPPONENT OUT OF ACTIONS IN ROUND NOTIFICATION? - prob is, even if opponent has to do a noop pass, this will give them info instead, so maybe just embrace? cool insentiv for canon fodder or dumb arms race?
terrain proficient unit
	snow yeti - ignore snow move out penalty
	otter - can move on water with additional terrain protection
	commando squat - ignore snow penalty - can move on water without protection
unit sizes (small/medium/large)?? Very design bloat, but allows for better top down design / knob tuning of stuff like the ice terrain (relying on max hp will have lots of weird cases).
	also cool for transportation / unit displacement
	larger units gets worse terran protection
thoughts about "standard play"
	an army is build for a map pool (prob 5)
	a map is a procedure for generating a symmetrical set of hexes to play on
	map decides both the size/shape of the board (although generally this will prob be pretty standardized), the capture/deployment zones (prob also pretty standardized) and the terrain (should vary a lot)
	the map also defines the size of the deployment (how many points worth of units you get from your army). prob also a max amount of units?
	a game first involves one player being presented with a random subset of the pool (prob 4) and banning some about (prob 2). then the other player selects the map from the remining ones (prob 2 remaining).
	then each player simultaniously decides their deployment and places it in their deployment zone, then plays the "actual" game.
	map is also responsible for defining point win threshold, and max number of rounds (normally this should be a standardized safety valve, but there is design space in "who can get more points in 3 rounds or whatever").
	this way you can easily have a "rotating" format, and different unit strengths can be more and less relevant. building an army for a map pool should be a cool balancing act.
unit price resources?
	units have a generic point value that descibes how much they are worth, but maybe there should also be other resources, associated with specific mechanics/specializations/roles? this way maps get to fine tune how much "value" worth of flyers a player gets for example. this allows for more extreme map varriety, where for example a map with a lot of obstacles doesn't just become all flyers.
	something like:
		- white (w) - mobility
		- blue (u) - flyer
		- red (r) - ranged
		- green (g) - high value units (if this can't be limited, then you might end up in a situation where the correct thing is to get very few units on a very small map, for very boring gameplay. altenativly a map can just ban units costing>n?)
		- purple (p) - support/spells/high synergi
	maybe also a vision one?
code for points is v
	cost writen like 10uu or 7rpp
buildings?
	immovable
	no terrain protection
power runes on map
	move over +1 movement point
	single vp pickup

	another top-down design angle
stealh while not moving
aa tank
	multi target missile attack
shaolin frog
	3 movement

	pseudo flying
		ignores terrain penalties
		no terrain protection
			or at most 1?
		self/opponent FoV like flying
		can be meleed
	beam attack
		attacks 3 consecutive hexes
map ideas:

	note about directions (P1, P2 are starting areas):

		N
	W P1 P2 E 
		S

	jungle brawl
		small map, dense forest / jungle terrain. maybe clearing in the center? low flyer resource.
	river
		map divided by (not unbroken river) W-E. medium terrain
	jotunheim
		bunch of ice, with a lava crag in the middle. close to lave water is ice instead etc
	frosty peaks
		large maps with sporadic wood clusters and jagged mountain lines. mountains are snow in the center of the clusters
	trench war
		mostly flat with low vegetation. Two crack lines divide the map N-S.
	arid mesa
		large platou in the middle surrounded by mostly flat desert.
	oasis
		lake in the middle, surrondded desert/shrub/dunes. middle capture zone is a ring surrounding lake
	in medias res
		starting areas very close to each other. one time player specific point pickups behind opponent for each player
		hilly landscape, medium vegetation
	swamp mix-up
		medium sized map with thick jungle/swamp, multiple small scattered deployment zones
	cauldron
		middle capture area surrounded by unpassable mountain ring, with a few gaps. medium elvevation, sparse vegetation, except for the middle.

dragon
	2 movement - 9 health - 2 vision
	toggleable flying - +2 movement and flying, take off/land free combineable ability. use energy to fly? starts grounded.
	breath attack - 2 hex line - 3 damage aoe + 3 burn - 1 move cost - physical propagation when grounded
	melee attack - 5 damage - 1 move cost
	big expensive
unready targeted unit ability/attack
ground stakes - hex status - move in damage scaled equal to distance to position at the beginnig of turn
movement cost attack ability. can always be used if unit has not moved. when used unit looses that many movement points. if unit has moved, it must have the movement points to spend.
	action can have a move cost of zero, which then means the unit must not have negativ movement points left if it has moved.
"bat" sight, can only see presence of unit, nothing else.

day/night cycle?
	night -1 sight (min 1)
	amount of rounds of day/night in a cycle, and where in the cycle the game starts can vary depending on map
weather (bloat, this time for real). but maybe these can just be like global statuses on certain maps?
	hot
		units ending turn with no unspent movement points suffer 1 damage
	cold
		units ending round with no adjacent allied units suffer 1 damage
	rain
		-1 sight (min 1)
	windy

		all units above n points -2 points cost
		+n points/resource
		bonus for unit duplicates / uniques
		discount units costing certain resources
	opponents hero is visible while deploying

not really sure what to do with this:
	warp entity
	movement 2, health 5, sight 2, S
	open gate
		ability
		target two hexes range 4
		-1 movement
		cooldown 4 rounds
		each hex gets linked status gate for 2 rounds
			independently stackable
			when a unit enters, teleport it to linked hex
	force wall
		aoe ability
		aoe type line length 3 range 3
		cooldown 2 rounds
		each hex gets force bloced for 2 rounds
			non stackable, refreshable
			a unit moving into this hex loses all remaning movement points
	gate ability makes a lot more sense on the date demon thingy. force wall is cool, but together with what?
this ones dumb, like the shrivel idea, though:
	depressor
	movement 3, health 5, sight 2, S
	entropic ray
		ranged attack
		2 damage, 2 range
		-1 movement
	shrivel
		aoe ability
		aoe type hex size 1 range 4
		-2 movement
		apply shriveled to all units in aoe until they skip
			stackable
			-1 max health
debuff share vision with target
readied on attacked
combineable melee attack only
cost related abilities
	- bulk discount
not sure how to make this make sense:
	immolation orb
	health 8, movement 2, sight 1, S
	- flying
	- whenever a unit engages this unit, or ends it movement adjacent to this unit, apply 1 burn to that unit.
	- at the end of round, apply 2 burn to all adjacent units
