lucky goblin
anything with break
engages - anything with "moves from" - battle ball - guerrilla squad stakes
presence vision + bat
jaguar
"ignore one per turn" etc. - need to maintain state.
time knight pocket acceleration - don't think this is reasonably possible
    maybe something like, collect all the relevant effects, and then manually call their resolve methods.
terraforming mage - fault line - annoying level of context required for terrain protection
kraken - movement ability - very annoying since its two different effects needing the same hook state. will need to do it as 3 separate effects.
serene master - needs to keep track of damage and debuff sources
    also trigger dependent on outcome of event
gate fiend - open gate - all hexes needs to be checked for legal move into. better would prob be to have a modifiable "get_move_target_for_unit" on the map.
colossus walker - need a lot of modifiables with a lot of context to support this, but think i want that anyway...
missile mech lock on - need to be able to link effects

radiated - status needs to have apply hook for the armor thing
