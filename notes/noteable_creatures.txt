lucky goblin
anything with break
engages - anything with "moves from" - battle ball - guerrilla squad stakes
presence vision + bat
jaguar
flame wall effects trigger timing - needs explicit support?
ephemeral replacement effects - prob don't need explicit support, since it can be done in the resolve, plus all the
    cases we need it statuses, which needs more complicated logic anyway.
"ignore one per turn" etc. - need to maintain state.
time knight pocket acceleration - don't think this is reasonably possible
    maybe something like, collect all the relevant effects, and then manually call their resolve methods.

shadow operative - needs to have a "provides vision for" modifiable.
terraforming mage - fault line - annoying level of context required for terrain protection
kraken - movement ability - very annoying since its two different effects needing the same hook state. will need to do it as 3 separate effects.
cyclops - stare - keep in mind for how vision works
serene master - needs to keep track of damage and debuff sources
    also trigger dependent on outcome of event
gate fiend - open gate - all hexes needs to be checked for legal move into. better would prob be to have a modifiable "get_move_target_for_unit" on the map.
colossus walker - need a lot of modifiables with a lot of context to support this, but think i want that anyway...

radiated - status needs to have apply hook for the armor thing
