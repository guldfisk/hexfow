lucky goblin
anything with break
engages - anything with "moves from" - battle ball - guerrilla squad stakes
presence vision + bat
jaguar
flame wall effects trigger timing - needs explicit support?
ephemeral replacement effects - prob don't need explicit support, since it can be done in the resolve, plus all the
    cases we need it statuses, which needs more complicated logic anyway.
"ignore one per turn" etc. - need to maintain state.
time knight pocket acceleration - don't think this is reasonably possible
    maybe something like, collect all the relevant effects, and then manually call their resolve methods.

CURSOR : time knight
